For this final project, id like to make a pokemon team builder website. Why I want to make this because calling other websites for api and applying drag and drop will work well with this project. I want to make a simple website. For casuals, because i'm a casual player of pokemon. I dont plan but when I gave it a try, pokemon team maker websites look too complicated. I want this website to look easy for users.
I want to make two seperate boxes for creating team and searchin for pokemon. One side is to store six pokemon. How to get the pokemon is to search through a filter box. Then when you found what you like. You choose it and drag this pokemon to the other side. Then the data ill transfer.
I want to store this information. So I will have them sign in with their names when they first get on the website. This could be a user, doesnt matter what they are called. Once they are done with their team. I will give them a choice to screenshot their team or email it to their email of choice.
